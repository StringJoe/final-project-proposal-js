        <h2>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:</h2>

        <div class="align-list">
            <ol>
                <li>Product Name: Turtles VS Dragons</li>
                <li>Team Members: Joseph Santay</li>
                <li>Application Overview: In this game the goal of the user/player is to kill all 
                    dragons before they get past the edge of the screen. The player will have a
                    limited amount of lives that replenish after each wave is finished. As the game
                    progresses the waves will continue to get harder until it is impossible to continue
                    or the user decides to quit. There will be different kinds of turtles that the 
                    player can use to defend their base. They each have their own individual magic
                    abilities and weapons they can use to defend their base from attack.</li>
                <li>Technology Overview: From a technical standpoint, this game will simply use the built in canvas tag
                    in HTML to accomplish its goals. While it is possible a library will be used in
                    the creation of the game, there is no current plan to use one right now. This website
                    will be hosted on Microsoft Azure.

                <li>Future Feature List:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pause Button</li>
                        <li>Time Limit</li>
                        <li>Multiple Maps</li>
                        <li>Muliple Players</li>
                        <li>Time Limit</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Basic Technical Features: This Website will use some basic HTML and CSS to
                    manipulate the webpage. There will also be some basic JavaScript used to 
                    implement some of the player info.
                </li>
                <li>Advanced Technical Features: The only advanced technical feature being used
                    for this project is the canvas tag and the JavaScript used to manipulate it.
                    Sprite sheets will also be used to implement the characters in the game. While 
                    images have been used in this class, the sprite sheets will have multiple character
                    drawings on it making it more complex
                </li>
